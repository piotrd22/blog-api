# ASP.NET Core REST API

A very basic ASP.NET Core REST API that covers the crud for the blog. Everything is visible thanks to a simple swagger UI (/swagger/index.html).

This small project was aimed at learning .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Entity Framework, AutoMapper, etc.).

Additionally, the application was containerized (with https) using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcaDDxJv260
